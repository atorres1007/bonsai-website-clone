                Japanese maples are deciduous hardwood trees famous for red-burgundy or 
                green leaves that turn bright red, orange, or yellow in fall. The bark of 
                young Japanese maples is typically green or reddish, turning grey or 
                grayish-brown as it ages. 

                A warning to those bonsai enthusiasts who do not have a lot of time to 
                dedicate to the craftâ€”Japanese maples require a lot of water, especially
                 during the growing season. Depending on the temperature, they may 
                require daily watering, possibly even several times daily.
